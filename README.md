# RSS -> Q2 CMS Article Importer and Bug Patcher
This Chrome plugin was used to import RSS feed data into the ktvq.com CMS.

It also fixed several bugs and usability issues within the CMS.

The RSS feed was pulled from a personal server running some [custom scraper software](https://github.com/JonathanPorta/node-rss-comparator).
